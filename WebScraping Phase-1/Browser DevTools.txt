Browser DevTools 

1.What is Browser DevTools?

Browser Developer Tools (DevTools) are built-in tools in browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) that let you:

Inspect HTML & CSS

Debug JavaScript

Monitor network requests

Test APIs

Analyze performance


For web scraping, DevTools helps you find exactly where the data is on the page.



2.Main Panels in DevTools (Beginner Focus)

5 most important ones:

Elements

Console

Network

Application

Sources


1. Elements Panel (HTML + CSS)

What it is:

Shows the HTML structure and CSS styles of the page.


Why important:

See how a website is built

Find tags for web scraping

Modify UI temporarily

Practical Example:

Open any website → Right click on text → Inspect

       <h1 class="title">Welcome</h1>

Now you can:

Change text directly

Change color in CSS

Find IDs & classes for scraping



Real use:

If you want to scrape product names:

    soup.find_all("h1", class_="title")




2. Console Panel (JavaScript)

What it is:

A place to run JavaScript commands.


Why important:

Debug errors

Test code quickly

Extract data from page


Practical Example:

document.title -> write on console 

output: like title amazon india



3. Network Panel 

What it is:

Shows all requests made by the browser:

APIs

Images

JSON data


Why important:

Find hidden APIs

See request headers

Reverse engineer websites



Practical Example:


Open Network tab

Refresh page

Click Fetch/XHR

You’ll see requests like:

https://api.example.com/products


Click it → Response:


[
  {"id":1,"name":"Phone","price":10000}
]


Real use:

Now you can call that API directly:

import requests
res = requests.get("https://api.example.com/products")
print(res.json())

no scraping needed




4. Application Panel (Storage & Cookies)

headers = {
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1"
}

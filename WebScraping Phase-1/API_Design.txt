2 API Design

2.1 HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)

A protocol for communication between client and server.
Works on request–response model.
Used by web browsers and APIs.

2.2 HTTP Methods

HTTP methods define the type of request a client makes to a server.
They are essential for API design.
They enable communication between client and server.

Common HTTP methods:

GET – Read data

POST – Create data

PUT – Update/replace data

PATCH – Partially update data

DELETE – Remove data

2.3 HTTP Status Codes

Show the result of an API request.
Are 3-digit numbers.
First digit indicates response type.

Example:

200 → Success

404 → Not found

Help in debugging and understanding APIs.

2.4 HTTP Headers

HTTP Headers carry extra information between client and server.
They are part of request and response messages.

Content type

Authentication

Cookies

Important for:

Secure communication

Proper data exchange

Error handling

2.5 Cookies

Cookies are small data stored in the browser.
They enable stateful sessions in HTTP.

Used in:

Authentication

Storing session tokens

Help in:

Keeping users logged in

Maintaining user sessions

Improving user experience

Securing user data


2.6 URL, Query & Path Parameters

URL: URL identifies the resource on the server.

Query parameters are used for:

Filtering

Sorting

Searching data

Path parameters : represent variable values in the URL.

They help in:

Customizing responses
Efficient data retrieval
Making APIs scalable and user-friendly

2.7 TCP/IP

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.

It is the basic communication protocol of the Internet.

Focus on:

Data delivery

Correct order of data

Error checking

APIs use TCP/IP to communicate over networks.

Understanding TCP/IP helps in better API design.


Different API styles:

1 What are APIs

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

APIs allow software applications to communicate with each other.

They hide internal complexity and expose only required functionality.

Define:

How to send data

How to retrieve data

How to modify data

APIs enable:

System integration

Data exchange

Modern software development


2. Types of API (Styles)

REST – Simple, JSON-based.

SOAP – XML, secure, strict.

GraphQL – Client chooses data.

gRPC – Very fast, binary.

WebSocket – Real-time.

3. Difference between each API

REST → Most common, easy.

SOAP → Secure, complex.

GraphQL → Flexible data.

gRPC → High performance.

WebSocket → Live communication.

1. What is Requests ? 


Requests is a Python library used to send HTTP requests to web servers and get responses.

In simple words:

Requests helps your Python program talk to websites and APIs.


You can:

Fetch web pages

Send data to servers

Call APIs

Download files

Upload files


2. Making a Request (Definition)

A request means: asking a server for something.

Example:

import requests
r = requests.get("https://api.github.com/events")


Here:

get() → send a GET request

URL → where you are sending it

r → response object (server reply)



3. HTTP Methods

Definition:

HTTP methods tell the server what action you want to perform.

Main Points:

Method	      Meaning

GET	   ->   Read data
POST	   ->   Send data
PUT	   ->   Update data
DELETE	   ->   Remove data
HEAD	   ->   Only headers
OPTIONS	   ->   Check allowed methods

Example:

requests.get(url)
requests.post(url)
requests.put(url)
requests.delete(url)
requests.head(url)
requests.options(url)


4. Passing Parameters in URL

Definition:

Query parameters are data sent in the URL.

Main Points:

Sent after ?

Use params in Requests

Automatically encoded


Example:

payload = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
r = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get", params=payload)
print(r.url)

output:

https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2



5. Response Object

Definition:

A Response object contains everything returned by the server.

Main Points:

It includes:

Status code

Headers

Body content

Example:

r = requests.get(url)
print(r)


6. Response Text

Definition:

r.text gives response as human-readable text.

Main Points:

Used for HTML, JSON, text

Automatically decodes

Example:

r = requests.get("https://api.github.com/events")
print(r.text)



7. Encoding

Definition:

Encoding tells how bytes are converted to text.

Main Points:

Requests guesses encoding

Can change manually



8. Binary Content

Definition:

r.content gives response as raw bytes.

Main Points:

Used for images, videos, PDFs

Returns bytes (b'')


Example:

r = requests.get("https://example.com/image.png")
print(r.content)



9. JSON Response

Definition:

r.json() converts JSON into Python objects.

Main Points:

Returns dict or list

Raises error if not valid JSON

Example:

r = requests.get("https://api.github.com/events")
data = r.json()
print(data[0])



10. Custom Headers

Definition:

Headers send extra information with request.

Main Points:

Used for authentication

Used in scraping

User-Agent important

Example:

headers = {"User-Agent": "my-app/1.0"}
requests.get(url, headers=headers)


11. POST Form Data

Definition:

Send data like HTML forms.

Main Points:

Uses data

Encoded automatically

Example:

payload = {"username": "admin", "password": "123"}
requests.post(url, data=payload)


12. POST JSON Data

Definition:

Send JSON directly.

Main Points:

Uses json

Sets Content-Type automatically

Example:

requests.post(url, json={"name": "john"})




13. raise_for_status()

Definition:

Raises error if request failed.

Main Points:

Stops program on error

Good for debugging


Example:

r.raise_for_status()


14. Response Headers

Definition:

Response headers are server metadata.

Main Points:

Case insensitive

Stored as dictionary


Example:

print(r.headers["Content-Type"])



15. Timeouts

Definition:

Timeout stops waiting forever.

Main Points:

Very important in real projects

Prevents hanging

Example:

requests.get(url, timeout=5)



26. Errors & Exceptions

Definition:

Exceptions occur when request fails.


Main Points:

Common errors:

ConnectionError

Timeout

HTTPError

TooManyRedirects


Example:

requests.exceptions.RequestException

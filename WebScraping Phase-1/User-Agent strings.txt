1 user-agent strings

A User-Agent (UA) is a text message sent by a device to a website. It tells the website which device is being used (phone, laptop, or bot), which operating system it has (Android, iOS, Windows), and which browser is being used (Chrome, Safari, Edge). This helps the website show the correct content for the user.

how exactly work:

Which device (phone, laptop, bot, etc.)

Which system (Android, iOS, Windows)

Which browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge)



example - Android

User-Agent:

Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36

Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10) Chrome/114.0 Mobile

means: 

 Android 10   ->  Phone system 
 Chrome 114   ->  Browser      
 Mobile       ->  It’s a phone 

So the website understands:

This user is on an Android phone using Chrome.


example - Windows laptop

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) Chrome/120.0


Means:

Windows 10 computer

Chrome browser

So website shows desktop version.




example - bots Google

Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1)

Means:

This is not a human

It’s Google robot crawling the site



2.importants of User-Agent


a) Website behavior

Websites change content based on UA:

Mobile users → mobile layout

Desktop users → desktop layout


b) Web scraping

Some websites block bots.

So we fake a real browser UA.


c) Analytics

Companies track:

Which browsers users use

Which devices are popular



3.Important Notes

User-Agent can be faked

Not secure for authentication


Some sites check:

IP

Cookies

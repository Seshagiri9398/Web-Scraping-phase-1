1. What is curl_cffi?

curl_cffi is a Python HTTP client that can pretend to be a real browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) at a deep level.

Unlike requests or httpx, it does not just send headers — it also copies:

TLS / JA3 fingerprint

HTTP/2 fingerprint

So websites think:

“This request is coming from a real Chrome browser.”



2. Why curl_cffi exists (the problem it solves)

Modern websites use bot detection like:

Cloudflare

Akamai

DataDome

Kasada

They check:

TLS fingerprint

HTTP/2 behavior

Header patterns


Example:

If you use:

requests.get(url)


You may get:

403 Forbidden

Empty page

Captcha

Because your TLS fingerprint looks like a bot.

curl_cffi fixes this by using libcurl-impersonate (real browser fingerprints).



3. How curl_cffi works 

Normal requests:

Your Script → Python TLS → Website
Website → "This is not Chrome" → Block


curl_cffi:

Your Script → curl_cffi
curl_cffi → Real Chrome TLS + HTTP/2 fingerprint
Website → "This is Chrome" → Allow

It uses:

Real browser TLS signatures

Real HTTP/2 behavior

Real header ordering


4. The parameter: impersonate

This is the main feature.


Example:

import curl_cffi

r = curl_cffi.get(
    "https://tls.browserleaks.com/json",impersonate="chrome"
)

print(r.json())

Now your request looks exactly like Chrome.


5. What exactly is being impersonated?


  Layer         What curl_cffi copies 

  TLS           ->JA3 fingerprint       
  HTTP/2        ->Frame patterns        
  Headers       ->Real browser headers  
  Order         ->Header ordering       
  SSL           ->Cipher suites         

6. Supported browsers

You can impersonate:

impersonate="chrome"
impersonate="firefox"
impersonate="safari"
impersonate="edge"
impersonate="tor"


Specific versions:


impersonate="chrome124"
impersonate="firefox135"
impersonate="safari184"



7. Sessions (cookies like real browser)

from curl_cffi import Session

s = Session()
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/user/sesha")
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")

print(r.json())

Just like a browser:

Cookies persist

Sessions maintained



8. Proxies + Impersonation

proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}

r = curl_cffi.get(
    "https://example.com",
    impersonate="chrome",
    proxies=proxies
)


Now:

IP from proxy

Fingerprint from Chrome

Perfect for scraping.


9. Async scraping (fast)

import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async def main():
    async with AsyncSession() as s:
        r = await s.get("https://example.com", impersonate="chrome")
        print(r.text)

asyncio.run(main())

High speed + browser identity.



10. Real-world analogy

Imagine entering a gated office:


requests → shows fake ID → blocked

httpx → better fake ID → still blocked

curl_cffi → real employee badge → allowed

Playwright → real person enters



12. When should YOU use curl_cffi?


For your web scraping projects:


 Situation       Best tool  
 -----------    ---------- 
 Simple site   -> requests   
 403 error     -> curl_cffi  
 Cloudflare    -> curl_cffi  
 JS-heavy      -> Playwright 
 Login flow    -> Selenium
